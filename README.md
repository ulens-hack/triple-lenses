# triple-lenses

Here we're going to develop a ray shooter for triple lenses from scratch. The *basic* goals are to

- Learn about microlensing with a hands-on problem
- Understand the equations for a triple lens
- Calculate the magnification map for a triple lens using ray shooting

The *stretch* goals are

- Find ways to optimize the algorithm
- Fit it to real data
